# Capstone Project Details

The capstone project is the culmination of the course, where students apply everything they have learned.

## Objective
Build a **simulated humanoid robot** that:
- Perceives its environment using sensors  
- Navigates obstacles  
- Identifies objects using computer vision  
- Executes voice commands using AI models  

## Deliverables
- Fully functional simulation environment  
- ROS 2 packages for robot control  
- AI modules for perception and navigation  
- Documentation of implementation and results  

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and accuracy of perception and navigation  
- Correct execution of voice commands and tasks  
- Code quality and modularity  
- Creativity and innovation in robot behavior
