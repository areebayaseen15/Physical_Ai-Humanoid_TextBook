# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook!

## Introduction

This textbook has been **specifically designed for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course**. 

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate in the **physical world** rather than just in digital spaces. These systems perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments, interacting with humans, objects, and the surrounding environment. Unlike traditional AI models that exist only in simulations or data, Physical AI focuses on **embodied intelligence**, where the AI “lives” in a robot body and learns through real-world experiences.

**Humanoid Robotics** involves designing and controlling robots that resemble human bodies in form and function. By combining Physical AI with humanoid robots, students learn to build machines capable of walking, manipulating objects, perceiving environments, and executing complex tasks similar to humans.

This course and textbook provide a **comprehensive roadmap** for understanding, simulating, and deploying humanoid robots. Through **theoretical concepts, robotic simulations, and hands-on exercises**, students will bridge the gap between a digital AI brain and its physical embodiment.

### Real-World Applications and Capstone Project

By the end of the course, students will apply their knowledge in a **capstone project**: building a simulated humanoid robot that perceives its environment, navigates obstacles, recognizes objects, and executes tasks using AI models. Physical AI and humanoid robots have real-world applications in:

- Collaborative workplace robots  
- Service robots in human-centered environments  
- Research in embodied AI and autonomous systems  

This hands-on experience prepares students for **careers in robotics, AI, and autonomous systems** while demonstrating how AI can operate effectively in physical space.

## How to Use this Textbook

This textbook is designed as a **step-by-step guide** for learning Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

1. **Follow Modules Sequentially:** Learn foundational topics (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity) before advanced systems (NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action).  
2. **Engage in Hands-On Exercises:** Simulate robots, run experiments, and integrate AI agents.  
3. **Simulations and Physical Deployment:** Practice in both virtual environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) and on edge devices (Jetson, sensors).  
4. **Apply Knowledge in the Capstone Project:** Build a fully autonomous humanoid simulation performing perception, navigation, and manipulation tasks.  
5. **Interactive Learning with AI Assistance:** Use AI agents for guidance, debugging, and personalized learning.  
6. **Track Your Progress:** Use the sidebar to navigate chapters and revisit concepts as needed.
