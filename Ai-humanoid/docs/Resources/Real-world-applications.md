## 1. Collaborative Workplace Robots
Humanoid robots are increasingly deployed in **industrial and office environments** to work alongside humans.  
- Assembly and inspection tasks  
- Transporting goods in warehouses  
- Co-working with humans safely using sensors and AI control  
- Example: **Unitree Go1** performing object delivery in a factory

## 2. Service and Healthcare Robots
Robots that resemble humans are ideal for **assisting in human-centered environments**.  
- Healthcare: patient monitoring, medication delivery  
- Hospitality: concierge, room service, information assistance  
- Elderly care: companionship, reminders, and basic physical assistance  
- Example: **SoftBank Pepper** interacting with patients in hospitals
