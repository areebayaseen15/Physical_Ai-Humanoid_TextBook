# Tips & Best Practices for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Practical advice to help students and practitioners work effectively with simulations, edge AI kits, and robots.

---

## 1. Simulation Tips
- Always **start experiments in Gazebo or Isaac Sim** before running on physical hardware.  
- Break down complex tasks into smaller ROS 2 nodes.  
- Use logging extensively to debug robot behavior.  

## 2. Hardware Tips
- Ensure your GPU drivers and CUDA versions are compatible with Isaac Sim.  
- Start with **Jetson Nano/Orin kits** before scaling to full humanoids.  
- Keep edge devices and sensors calibrated for accurate perception.  

## 3. Software & Development Tips
- Use **version control (Git)** for all code and simulation setups.  
- Document your ROS 2 packages, launch files, and simulation environments.  
- Modularize AI perception, control, and planning code for easy debugging.  

## 4. Project & Capstone Tips
- Plan capstone tasks in stages: perception → navigation → manipulation → VLA integration.  
- Test each module individually before integration.  
- Maintain a logbook of experiments, errors, and lessons learned.  

## 5. Collaboration & Learning
- Pair programming or team work improves learning efficiency.  
- Participate in forums (ROS Answers, NVIDIA DevTalk) for troubleshooting.  
- Share simulation assets and scripts to accelerate progress.
