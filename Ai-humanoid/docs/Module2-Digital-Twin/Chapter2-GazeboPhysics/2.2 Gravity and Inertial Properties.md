### 2.2 Gravity and Inertial Properties

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the role of gravity in physics simulations.
- Learn about inertial properties of simulated robots.
- Configure Gazebo models with realistic mass, inertia, and center of mass.

Gravity is a fundamental force acting on all physical objects. In Gazebo, correctly setting gravity ensures realistic behavior of robots and their interactions with the environment. Without proper gravity settings, robots may float, fall unnaturally, or behave inconsistently with real-world expectations.

**Inertial Properties:**
- **Mass:** Total weight of a link or robot component.
- **Inertia Tensor:** Describes how mass is distributed relative to rotation axes, affecting angular motion.
- **Center of Mass (COM):** Point where the mass is considered to be concentrated. Crucial for balance and stability in humanoid robots or manipulators.

Gazebo allows specifying these properties in the **SDF (Simulation Description Format)** or URDF files. Example for a simple link:

```xml
<link name="robot_base">
  <inertial>
    <mass>2.5</mass>
    <inertia>
      <ixx>0.02</ixx>
      <iyy>0.02</iyy>
      <izz>0.03</izz>
      <ixy>0.0</ixy>
      <ixz>0.0</ixz>
      <iyz>0.0</iyz>
    </inertia>
    <pose>0 0 0.125 0 0 0</pose> <!-- x y z roll pitch yaw -->
  </inertial>
</link>
Gravity Configuration Example in Gazebo:

<world name="default">
  <gravity>0 0 -9.81</gravity>
</world>
Gravity can be customized per world. By default, Gazebo applies Earth-like gravity (9.81 m/s² downward).

Correct inertial and gravity settings ensure accurate simulation of balance, tipping, and collision responses.

Python Example with ROS 2 Gazebo Plugins:

Python Example with ROS 2 Gazebo Plugins:
import rclpy
from gazebo_msgs.srv import SpawnEntity

def spawn_robot(node, urdf_file_path):
    client = node.create_client(SpawnEntity, '/spawn_entity')
    request = SpawnEntity.Request()
    request.name = "my_robot"
    with open(urdf_file_path, 'r') as f:
        request.xml = f.read()
    future = client.call_async(request)
    rclpy.spin_until_future_complete(node, future)
    return future.result()

rclpy.init()
node = rclpy.create_node('spawn_robot_node')
result = spawn_robot(node, 'path/to/robot.urdf')
print("Spawn result:", result)
rclpy.shutdown()
Key Terms for RAG: Gravity, Inertia, Center of Mass, Mass Distribution, Gazebo SDF, URDF, ROS 2 Gazebo Plugins, Physics Simulation Accuracy, Balance, Stability.

Cross-Reference: Section 2.3 will cover collision detection and contact response using these inertial and gravity settings.
