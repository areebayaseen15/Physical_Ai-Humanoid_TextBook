# Chapter 3: Python Agents with rclpy

Welcome to Chapter 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This chapter focuses on Python-based ROS 2 development using `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2.

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides services such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. `rclpy` is the Python implementation that allows Python developers to create ROS 2 nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, provide and use services, and work with actions.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to create Python-based agents that can effectively communicate with ROS-based robot controllers, bridging the gap between AI algorithms implemented in Python and physical robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Create and manage Python ROS 2 nodes using `rclpy`
2. Implement publish-subscribe communication patterns in Python
3. Develop service clients and servers using Python
4. Create action clients and servers for complex operations
5. Bridge Python AI agents to ROS controllers for practical robotics applications
6. Structure content for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is divided into four comprehensive sections:

- **Section 1**: Creating Python ROS 2 nodes - Understanding the fundamental building blocks
- **Section 2**: Implementing topics in Python - Mastering publish-subscribe communication
- **Section 3**: Python service clients and servers - Working with synchronous operations
- **Section 4**: Python action clients and servers - Handling long-running tasks with feedback

Each section includes practical examples, code snippets, and exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of Python-ROS integration.
