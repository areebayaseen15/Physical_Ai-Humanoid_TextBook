## Context
You are generating **Chapter 2 content – Section: [Node]** for:

**Book Title:** Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — An AI-Native Textbook for Panaversity  
**Module:** 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)  
**Chapter:** 2 — Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions  

**Reference Files:**  
- `/sp.specify` output for Chapter 2

  - Python code snippets (rclpy)
  - Diagram placeholders
  - RAG chunk comments
  - Recommended exercises

- Follow ROS 2 Humble conventions  
- Expand abbreviations at first mention  
- Keep content concise and token-efficient  

## Instructions
1. Use `/sp.plan` to guide sub-sections of [Nodes]  
2. For each sub-section:
   - Write explanation
   - Add Python code snippet placeholder
   - Add diagram placeholder
   - Highlight key terms for RAG
   - Include exercises if applicable
3. Maintain Markdown/MDX structure and RAG chunk comments  

## Output
