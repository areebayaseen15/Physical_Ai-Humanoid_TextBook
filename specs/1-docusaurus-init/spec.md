# Feature Specification: Initialize Docusaurus Book Project

**Feature Branch**: `1-docusaurus-init`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Prompt for Claude Code: Initialize Hackathon Docusaurus Book Project\n\nYou are a Spec-Driven AI agent. Follow these instructions strictly:\n\n## Goal:\nInitialize an empty Docusaurus project scaffold for the Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, fully aligned with the constitution (`sp.constitution.md`) and all generated skills in `.claude/skills/`. \nThe project should be **ready for chapter-wise content generation later**. No chapters are generated yet.\n\n## Constraints:\n1. Use Docusaurus framework for the book.\n2. Apply all relevant skills automatically from .claude/skills/ for setup and future content generation.\n"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Setup Docusaurus Scaffold (Priority: P1)

As a project developer, I want to initialize a basic Docusaurus project structure so that I have a foundation to build the textbook.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step for the entire book project. Without it, no content can be generated.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the presence of Docusaurus project files and folders, and by successfully running the Docusaurus development server.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a clean project directory, **When** the Docusaurus initialization command is run, **Then** a functional Docusaurus project scaffold is created with default Docusaurus files.
2.  **Given** a functional Docusaurus project, **When** `npm install` and `npm start` are run from the project root, **Then** the Docusaurus development server starts successfully and displays the default homepage in a web browser.

### User Story 2 - Align with Project Constitution (Priority: P1)

As a project developer, I want the Docusaurus scaffold to be configured in alignment with the project constitution and ready to integrate existing skills so that future development adheres to project standards.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the project starts on the right foot, following architectural principles (e.g., `III. Modular & Single-Responsibility Skills`) and enabling skill-driven automation from day one.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing `docusaurus.config.js` for project metadata and by verifying the project structure is prepared to accept content and features generated by `.claude/skills/` (e.g., through appropriate `docs` or `src` subdirectories).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a newly initialized Docusaurus project, **When** initial configuration is applied, **Then** `docusaurus.config.js` reflects basic project metadata (e.g., `title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook"`, `tagline`) that aligns with the textbook's purpose.
2.  **Given** a Docusaurus project, **When** relevant skills are considered for future integration, **Then** the project structure is prepared with appropriate directories (e.g., `docs` for chapters, `src/components` for custom UI) to accept content and features generated by `.claude/skills/`.

### Edge Cases

-   **Existing Docusaurus Project**: What happens if Docusaurus is already partially initialized? (Assumption: For initial setup, we assume a clean state. Future iterations might handle updates.)
-   **Network Issues**: How does the system handle network issues during `npm install`? (Assumption: Standard npm error reporting will suffice).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: System MUST create a standard Docusaurus project scaffold using `npx create-docusaurus@latest`.
-   **FR-002**: System MUST configure `docusaurus.config.js` to set the project title to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" and a descriptive tagline.
-   **FR-003**: System MUST ensure the Docusaurus project structure includes a `docs` directory ready to receive and render markdown-based chapters and documentation.
-   **FR-004**: System MUST initialize a basic `sidebar.js` configuration that can be extended later for dynamic chapter navigation.
-   **FR-005**: System SHOULD create placeholder directories within `src/components` to anticipate future skill integration outputs (e.g., for RAG chatbot UI, personalization buttons, translation toggles) to minimize future refactoring.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

-   **Docusaurus Project:** The root structure, configuration files (`docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebar.js`), and content directories (`src`, `docs`). Represents the foundational digital textbook platform.
-   **Textbook:** The collection of chapters, guides, and supplementary materials that will reside within the Docusaurus project, generated and managed by Claude Code skills.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: A Docusaurus project scaffold can be initialized, dependencies installed (`npm install`), and successfully built/served locally (`npm start`) by any developer within 5 minutes on a typical development machine.
-   **SC-002**: The initialized Docusaurus project structure is consistent with Docusaurus best practices, enabling easy maintainability and extensibility for future features and content generation.
-   **SC-003**: Upon successful initialization, the Docusaurus site displays a default homepage with the correct project title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" and tagline.
