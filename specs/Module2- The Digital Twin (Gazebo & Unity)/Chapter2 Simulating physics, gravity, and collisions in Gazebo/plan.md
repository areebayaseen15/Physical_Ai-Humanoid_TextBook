# Chapter 2 Plan: Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo

## Sections & Sub-Sections

### Section 2.1: Introduction to Gazebo Simulation
- Definition and purpose of Gazebo.  
- Importance in Digital Twin development.  
- Key features (physics simulation, sensor simulation, ROS 2 integration).  

### Section 2.2: Physics Engine Overview
- Supported engines: ODE, Bullet, DART, Simbody.  
- Strengths, weaknesses, and typical use cases.  
- How engines simulate dynamics, collisions, constraints.  

### Section 2.3: Gravity and Collision Simulation
- Gravity setup in `.sdf` world files or plugins.  
- Collision shapes, friction, and material properties.  
- Impact on robot stability and interaction.  

### Section 2.4: Running a Sample Simulation
- Install ROS 2 Gazebo packages.  
- Create a simple world with plane and robot model.  
- Launch and observe physics interactions.  
- Validate collisions and gravity effects.  

## Deliverables
- Sub-chapter Markdown files, each properly chunked for RAG:  
  - Section 2.1 → `2.1_IntroToGazebo.md`  
  - Section 2.2 → `2.2_PhysicsEngineOverview.md`  
  - Section 2.3 → `2.3_GravityCollision.md`  
  - Section 2.4 → `2.4_SampleSimulation.md`  
- Include code snippets, diagram placeholders, and recommended exercises.  

## Notes
- Follow ROS 2 Humble conventions.  
- Maintain concise, technical, and AI-native style.  
- Each sub-section should be RAG-friendly (chunked with `<!-- CHUNK START --> ... <!-- CHUNK END -->`).
