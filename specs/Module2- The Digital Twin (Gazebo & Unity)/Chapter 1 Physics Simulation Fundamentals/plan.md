## Recommended Exercises / Implementation Steps
1. Create a Gazebo world with robot, gravity, and collision detection.  
2. Set up Unity scene with humanoid robot and object interactions.  
3. Simulate LiDAR, Depth Camera, and IMU sensors and collect sample data.  
4. Ensure diagrams and code placeholders are in place for each section.

## Notes
- Each section and sub-section must be **chunked for RAG-friendly Markdown/MDX**.  
- Include **Python snippets for Gazebo** and **C# snippets for Unity** where applicable.  
- Expand abbreviations at first mention (e.g., ROS 2 → ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)).  
- Maintain concise, technical, AI-native tone.
