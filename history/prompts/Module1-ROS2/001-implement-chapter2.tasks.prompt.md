# Prompt History Record

## Command
```
/sp.implement

## Context
You are generating **Chapter 2 content** for:

**Book Title:** Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — An AI-Native Textbook for Panaversity
**Module:** 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Chapter:** 2 — Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions

**Reference Files:**
- `book-structure.md` for official module/chapter blueprint.
- `/sp.specify` output for Chapter 2.
- `/sp.plan` output for Chapter 2.

**Audience:** Graduate-level robotics/AI students with basic Python knowledge.
**Tone:** Technical, engineering-focused, clean, precise.
**Format:** Markdown/MDX for Docusaurus.
**Chunking:** Each section/sub-section = one RAG-friendly chunk.

## Goals
- Generate the **entire Chapter 2 fully**, AND also generate **separate sub-chapter files**:
  - `Chapter2-01-Nodes.md`
  - `Chapter2-02-Topics.md`
  - `Chapter2-03-Services.md`
  - `Chapter2-04-Actions.md`
- Each sub-chapter must contain:
  - All section & sub-section headings
  - Technical explanations
  - Python code using `rclpy`
  - Diagram placeholders
  - RAG chunk markers
  - Exercises
  - Cross-references to Chapter 3
- Follow ROS 2 Humble conventions
- Expand abbreviations at first use
- Keep content concise and token-efficient

## Instructions
1. Use the **/sp.plan** output to structure all sections and sub-sections.
2. For **each** section/sub-section:
   - Write detailed technical explanation
   - Add rclpy Python code snippets
   - Add diagram placeholders (e.g., `<!-- DIAGRAM: Pub/Sub flow -->`)
   - Add RAG chunk comments:
     `<!-- CHUNK START: Section X --> ... <!-- CHUNK END: Section X -->`
   - Add key terms for indexing
   - Add exercises where appropriate
3. Output must contain:
   - **Full Chapter 2 combined version** (`Chapter2-NodesTopicsServicesActions.md`)
   - **Four separate sub-chapter files**:
     - `Chapter2-01-Nodes.md`
     - `Chapter2-02-Topics.md`
     - `Chapter2-03-Services.md`
     - `Chapter2-04-Actions.md`
4. Ensure every file is valid Markdown/MDX and ready for Docusaurus.
5. Maintr 2 (single file)
  2. Nodes sub-chapter file
  3. Topics sub-chapter file
  4. Services sub-chapter file
  5. Actions sub-chapter file

All formatted, chunked, and ready to save under:

`docs/Module1-ROS2/`
```

## Response Summary

Successfully implemented Chapter 2 content for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook. The following files were created:

1. `docs/Module1-ROS2/Chapter2-NodesTopicsServicesActions.md` - Complete combined chapter with RAG chunking
2. `docs/Module1-ROS2/Chapter2-01-Nodes.md` - Separate nodes section
3. `docs/Module1-ROS2/Chapter2-02-Topics.md` - Separate topics section
4. `docs/Module1-ROS2/Chapter2-03-Services.md` - Separate services section
5. `docs/Module1-ROS2/Chapter2-04-Actions.md` - Separate actions section

Each file contains:
- Technical explanations based on the plan.md specification
- Python code snippets using rclpy
- Diagram placeholders
- RAG chunk markers for retrieval-augmented generation
- Learning objectives and key concepts
- Exercises and cross-references

The content follows ROS 2 Humble conventions and is formatted for Docusaurus compatibility.

## Outcome

Chapter 2 content successfully generated with all required components. All files are properly formatted and ready for integration into the Docusaurus documentation site.

## Evaluation

The implementation fully satisfies the requirements specified in the original prompt. The content is technically accurate, follows the required structure, includes appropriate code examples, and is properly chunked for RAG systems.
