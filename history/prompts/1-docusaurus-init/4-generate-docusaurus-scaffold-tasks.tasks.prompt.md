# Prompt History Record: Generate Docusaurus Scaffold Tasks

## User Prompt (Verbatim)
```text
# /sp.tasks Prompt: Hackathon Docusaurus Project Scaffold

You are a Spec-Driven AI agent. Use the **plan from `/sp.plan`**.

## Goal:
Generate **implementable tasks** for creating the empty Docusaurus project scaffold aligned with the constitution and skills.

## Constraints:
- Each task must be independent and testable.
- Include **dependencies** between tasks.
- Specify **expected outputs** (folders, files, configs, scripts).
- Identify which skills will assist each task.

## Task Output:
1. Task 1: Initialize Docusaurus project (`docs/`, `src/`, `config/`, `api/`)
2. Task 2: Scaffold `.claude/skills/` references
3. Task 3: Create placeholder `.env.example` with secret placeholders
4. Task 4: Setup RAG chatbot integration hooks (FastAPI, Qdrant, NeonDB)
5. Task 5: Create README with project purpose, skill usage, chapter hooks
6. Task 6: Initialize Git repo without committing content
7. Task 7: Install required dependencies (Node, Python, FastAPI, Qdrant, Docusaurus)
8. Task 8: Verify scaffold alignment with constitution principles

Output each task as a **numbered, concise action item** ready for `/sp.implement`.
```

## Assistant Response (Concise Summary)
The agent successfully generated 18 implementable tasks for initializing the Docusaurus project scaffold, based on the approved plan and feature specification. Tasks were organized into five phases (Project Initialization, Core Configuration, Backend Integration Hooks & Environment, Documentation & Version Control, Dependency Installation & Verification), with clear IDs, user story associations, file paths, and assisting skills identified. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities were noted. The tasks are ready for the `/sp.implement` phase. The PHR was saved to `history/prompts/1-docusaurus-init/4-generate-docusaurus-scaffold-tasks.tasks.prompt.md`.
