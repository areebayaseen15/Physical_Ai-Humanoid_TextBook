# Prompt History Record: Plan Docusaurus Project Scaffold

## User Prompt (Verbatim)
```text
# /sp.plan Prompt: Hackathon Docusaurus Project Scaffold

You are a Spec-Driven AI agent. Use the **clarified requirements** from `/sp.clarify`.

## Goal:
Plan the **full project scaffold** for the Hackathon Textbook:
- Docusaurus project with empty docs, src, api, config folders
- RAG chatbot hooks
- Skills auto-discovery
- Git repo scaffold
- README with guidelines

## Constraints:
- Follow constitution principles strictly
- Only scaffold: no chapter content yet
- Modular skills must be referenced, not hardcoded
- Prepare for automation-first development

## Task:
1. Generate a **high-level architecture plan**: folders, key files, config references, scripts
2. Include **dependency plan**: Node, Python, FastAPI, Qdrant, NeonDB, Docusaurus, Skill integration
3. Identify **automation touchpoints** for skills
4. Identify **future content hooks** for chapters, RAG pipeline, personalization, translation

## Output:
- A numbered, actionable plan ready to feed into `/sp.tasks`
- Include **file tree skeleton** as part of the plan
```

## Assistant Response (Concise Summary)
The agent successfully generated the implementation plan for initializing the Docusaurus project scaffold for the Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. The plan (`specs/1-docusaurus-init/plan.md`) details the technical context, project structure (including a file tree skeleton), and conceptual design aspects for data models and API contracts. It also identifies automation touchpoints for skills and future content hooks. The plan adheres to the project constitution and is ready for task generation.
