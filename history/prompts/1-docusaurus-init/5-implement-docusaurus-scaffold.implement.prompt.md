## Prompt

```text
# /sp.implement Prompt: Hackathon Docusaurus Project Scaffold

You are a Spec-Driven AI agent. Use **tasks from `/sp.tasks`**.

## Goal:
Implement the **empty project scaffold** for Hackathon Textbook in **Docusaurus**, fully respecting:
- Hackathon Constitution
- Generated skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- RAG chatbot hooks
- Automation-first principles
- Modular TDD-ready files

## Constraints:
- No chapter content yet
- Do not commit to Git automatically
- Scaffold all folders, config files, scripts, README, `.env.example`, skill references
- Provide clear **inline comments in code/configs** explaining future use

## Task:
1. Generate **ready-to-run commands/code/scripts** to create folder structure.
2. Populate config files with placeholders for skills and RAG integration.
3. Create **README.md** with:
   - Project purpose
   - How to add chapters later
   - How skills will be applied
   - How RAG integration will be added later
4. Scaffold `.env.example` with required secrets for future RAG and personalization features.
5. Output **all commands/code/scripts** in a single block, ready for execution.
```

## Response snapshot

The Docusaurus project scaffold for the 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook' was successfully implemented. This involved manually creating core Docusaurus files (`package.json`, `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `src/pages/index.tsx`, `src/css/custom.css`, `docs/intro.md`), establishing the FastAPI backend structure (`api/`, `api/__init__.py`, `api/main.py`, `api/routers/`, `api/services/`), setting up environment configurations (`api/.env.example`, `api/requirements.txt`), creating documentation (`README.md`), and ensuring version control (`.gitignore`). Placeholder directories for Docusaurus components (`src/components/Chatbot/`, `src/components/Personalization/`, `src/components/Translation/`) and Urdu internationalization (`i18n/ur`) were also created. Dependencies were installed (`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`), a Python virtual environment was set up (`python -m venv api/venv`), and the Docusaurus development server was successfully started (`npm start`). The implementation adheres to the project's constitution principles and best practices, with a specific update to include Urdu localization. Initial issues with `npx create-docusaurus@latest` were resolved by adapting to a manual file creation approach.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All Docusaurus scaffold and backend integration points established.
- 🧪 Tests: npm dependencies installed, Python venv created, Docusaurus server starts.
- 📁 Files: All required Docusaurus files, API backend structure, and placeholder directories created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will likely proceed with book content creation or further RAG integration.
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered issues with `create-docusaurus@latest` requiring manual file creation. Successfully adapted and implemented all specified tasks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `npx create-docusaurus@latest` command arguments changed and "Directory already exists" errors when installing into a non-empty directory.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate `create-docusaurus@latest` behavior for non-empty directories or update the internal knowledge base on its command-line interface.
