# Prompt History Record: Initialize Docusaurus Project Scaffold

## User Prompt (Verbatim)
```text
# Prompt for Claude Code: Initialize Hackathon Docusaurus Book Project

You are a Spec-Driven AI agent. Follow these instructions strictly:

## Goal:
Initialize an empty Docusaurus project scaffold for the Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook, fully aligned with the constitution (`sp.constitution.md`) and all generated skills in `.claude/skills/`.
The project should be **ready for chapter-wise content generation later**. No chapters are generated yet.

## Constraints:
1. Use Docusaurus framework for the book.
2. Apply **all relevant skills** automatically from `.claude[Pasted text #1 +16 lines
```

## Assistant Response (Concise Summary)
The agent successfully generated the feature specification for initializing the Docusaurus project scaffold for the Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. A new branch `1-docusaurus-init` was created, and `specs/1-docusaurus-init/spec.md` was populated with user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria. A corresponding quality checklist was also generated. The spec was validated against the checklist and deemed complete and ready for planning.
