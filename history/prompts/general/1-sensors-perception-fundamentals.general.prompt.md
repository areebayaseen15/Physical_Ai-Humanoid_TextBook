# Prompt History Record: Sensors Perception Fundamentals Spec Generation

## Outcome
Successfully generated the specification for Chapter 1 of Module 2: "Sensors & Perception Fundamentals" for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## Evaluation
The specification document covers all mandatory sections including user scenarios, functional requirements, key entities, and success criteria. The spec focuses on what students need to learn about robotic sensors and perception systems without specifying implementation details. All requirements are testable and success criteria are measurable.

## Prompt Text
Generate spec for chapter 1 of Module 2

## Response Text
Created a comprehensive specification for Chapter 1: Sensors & Perception Fundamentals, covering fundamental sensor types, principles of operation, sensor integration, and basic perception algorithms with ROS 2/rclpy examples. The spec includes user stories, functional requirements, and measurable success criteria.
