# Prompt History Record: Generate Hackathon Project Constitution

## User Prompt (Verbatim)
```text
I want you to generate a full project constitution for my Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.

Use the following format exactly as a template, but fill in all sections and principles based on the project requirements I provide. Make sure it aligns with the Hackathon deliverables, modules, hardware/software requirements, skills, agent workflows, RAG chatbot integration, and personalization features.

Template format to follow:# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: ct changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contra-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

### [PRINCIPLE_6_NAME]


[PRINCIPLE__DESCRIPTION]

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
<!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
```

## Assistant Response (Concise Summary)
The agent successfully generated the full project constitution for the Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project. The constitution was filled based on the provided project requirements, aligning with deliverables, modules, hardware/software specifications, skills, agent workflows, RAG chatbot integration, and personalization features. All template placeholders were replaced, and core principles, technical stack, development workflow, and governance sections were populated. The constitution was written to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with version 1.0.0 and dated 2025-12-04.
